# GRIT

**G**eneral **R**ust **I**nterface **T**ool — A do-it-all CLI built with Rust.

**GRIT** is a modular, general-purpose command-line tool written in Rust, designed to provide a variety of small but powerful utilities under one interface. It's intended to grow into a flexible toolbox of developer-friendly commands.

> But it's mostly a personal project built for personal needs :)

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ `grit pwd`

Prints the current working directory as a single clean line — just like `pwd` on Unix-based systems.

#### ✅ Why this exists

In PowerShell, running the built-in `Get-Location` (or its alias `pwd`) returns output in a *formatted object* table:

```powershell
PS > pwd

Path
----
C:\Users\Safet\Projects\grit
```

This format is not ideal when you're scripting or trying to pipe it into something like `clip.exe`. For example, to get just the path as plain text, you'd need to do something awkward like:

```powershell
(pwd).Path | Select-Object -Last 1 | Set-Clipboard
```

Or even more verbose:

```powershell
(Get-Location).Path | ForEach-Object { $_ } | clip.exe
```

This is frustrating when you're used to the Unix (More like `WSL`) experience of:

```bash
pwd | clip.exe
```

With `grit pwd`, you get consistent, cross-platform output — no table formatting, no extra properties — just the raw path.

#### 📦 Example

```powershell
PS > grit pwd | clip.exe
```

That’s it. Clean and pipeable. No weird formatting. No extra parsing.

Let me know if you’d like to add similar Unix-friendly fixes or pipe-safe utilities to GRIT — it’s a great theme for building small but impactful tools.


More functionality will be added over time, each one designed to be intuitive and easily accessible through subcommands.

## Defining Secret Commands

**GRIT** CLI supports **secret commands** that can be dynamically loaded from a configuration file called `.secret.toml`. This allows you to add custom commands without modifying the code.

### File Location and Name

* The file must be named `.secret.toml`
> This will be configurable in the future.
* Place it in the same directory where you run the CLI tool (or configure the path as needed)

### File Format

The `.secret.toml` file uses the TOML format, with each secret command defined as a table.

Example `.secret.toml`:

```toml
[greet]
description = "Greets the user"
command = "echo Hello from TOML"

[date]
description = "Shows the current date"
command = "date"
```

### Fields

* **description**: A short description of the command, displayed when listing secret commands.
* **command**: The shell command that will be executed when the secret command is invoked.

### Using Secret Commands

* To **list** all secret commands:

  ```bash
  grit secret
  ```

* To **run** a secret command:

  ```bash
  grit secret greet
  ```

  This will execute the shell command defined for `greet`.

### Notes

* Secret commands are executed via the system shell (`sh` on Unix, `powershell` on Windows).
* You can pass additional arguments after the secret command name if your implementation supports argument substitution.
* Keep your `.secret.toml` file secure, especially if it contains sensitive commands.
* The CLI tool will show an error if you try to run an undefined secret command.


## 📦 Planned Commands

* `grit find <pattern>` – A fast file search tool
* `grit sysinfo` – Show basic system information
* `grit uuid` – Generate a UUID
* `grit hash <file>` – Hash a file using SHA algorithms
* ...and more
